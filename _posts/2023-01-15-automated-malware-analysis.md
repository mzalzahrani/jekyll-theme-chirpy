## Introduction

For the last couple of weeks, I have been poking around with a remarkable open-source project called MWDB-Core, short for Malware Database Core. The beauty of this project is its simplicity and powerful API that allows for seamless automation of malware collection and analysis workflows.

## MWDB-Core Overview

MWDB-Core is a RESTful API server designed to facilitate malware storage and analysis. It provides:

- **Centralized Storage**: Store and organize malware samples
- **Metadata Management**: Track analysis results and family classifications
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with analysis tools
- **User Management**: Multi-user environment with role-based access

## Setting Up MWDB-Core

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Docker and Docker Compose
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CERT-Polska/mwdb-core.git
cd mwdb-core

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d
```

## Automated Analysis Pipeline

The following Python script demonstrates how to automate malware submission:

```python
import requests
import hashlib
import os

class MWDBClient:
    def __init__(self, api_url, api_key):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    
    def upload_sample(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            files = {'file': f}
            response = requests.post(
                f'{self.api_url}/file',
                files=files,
                headers={'Authorization': self.headers['Authorization']}
            )
        return response.json()
```

## Integration with Analysis Tools

MWDB-Core can be integrated with various analysis tools:

- **Cuckoo Sandbox**: Dynamic analysis integration
- **YARA**: Static pattern matching
- **VirusTotal**: External threat intelligence
- **Custom Scripts**: Tailored analysis workflows

## Conclusion

MWDB-Core provides an excellent foundation for building automated malware analysis pipelines. Its API-first design makes it easy to integrate with existing security tools and workflows.

The ability to centralize malware storage while maintaining detailed metadata makes it an invaluable tool for incident response teams and malware researchers.
